KVSplice: Geometric Intuition
==============================

1. RAW MANIFOLD (Curved semantic space where KV vectors live)

         ╭────────╮
       ╱            ╲
      │   Semantic   │  ← High-dimensional curved surface
      │   Manifold   │     (where attention vectors live)
       ╲            ╱
         ╰────────╯


2. PCA ONLY: Local flat patches (discontinuous)

    Patch 1         Patch 2         Patch 3
    ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐         ┌─────┐
    │ ─── │   GAP!  │ ─── │   GAP!  │ ─── │
    │ ─── │  ╳╳╳╳╳  │ ─── │  ╳╳╳╳╳  │ ─── │
    └─────┘         └─────┘         └─────┘

    Each patch is a good LOCAL approximation,
    but transitions are SHARP (discontinuous)


3. SPLINE + PCA: Smooth connection between patches

    ╭──────╮      ╭──────╮      ╭──────╮
    │ ─ ─ ─│∼∼∼∼∼│─ ─ ─ │∼∼∼∼∼│─ ─ ─ │
    │ ─ ─ ─│∼∼∼∼∼│─ ─ ─ │∼∼∼∼∼│─ ─ ─ │
    ╰──────╯      ╰──────╯      ╰──────╯
       ↑             ↑             ↑
     PCA patch   Spline      PCA patch
                 smooth
                transition

    Splines PRE-WARP the space so that PCA patches
    connect smoothly (continuous derivatives)


4. CONTINUITY LEVELS (Future work)

   C⁰: Position continuous
   ────────────────────────  ← No gaps, but can have kinks
              ╱
             ╱

   C¹: Direction continuous
   ────────────╭───────────  ← Smooth flow, no kinks

   C²: Curvature continuous
   ─────────∼∼∼∼∼──────────  ← Smooth acceleration


5. THE FULL PIPELINE

   Original      Spline        PCA          Compressed
   Space      Warping       Projection       Latent

   [V]  ────►  [Z]  ────►  [Z_k]  ────►   Memory
   128D        128D         16D            (8× smaller)
    ↑           ↑            ↑
    │           │            │
  Curved    Straightened   Low-rank
  manifold   manifold      approximation


  Key: Spline learns to "straighten" the curved manifold
       so that PCA (which assumes flatness) works better!


6. SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION

   Token 1    Token 2    Token 3    Token 4
      •─────────•─────────•─────────•
      │         │         │         │
   Attend    Attend    Attend    Attend
   to past   to past   to past   to past

   Without KVSplice:
   • Each attention might "jump" between disconnected subspaces
   • Semantic flow has sharp transitions

   With KVSplice:
   • Attention flows smoothly through continuous geometry
   • Gradual semantic transitions (like following a curve)
   • Better interpolation between cached states
